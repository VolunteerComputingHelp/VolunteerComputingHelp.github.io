<h1>Volunteer Computing Help</h1>
<p>
This is a small web page to accompany a <a href="https://github.com/VolunteerComputingHelp">set of projects on github</a> that all aim at somehow augmenting
<ul>
<li>the user base - so the science of these projects gets carried into our society</li>
<li>the sheer power - we should use our hardware and the power it consumes to the best of its potential</li>
</ul>
of volunteer computing projects.
</p>

<p>
We use this site to communicate the extra mile (kilometer for us) that users (or project administrators) may have to go to reproduce our work or to integrate that new development in their routine setup. Developments you may be interested to follow-up are:
<ul>
<li>Einstein@Home Linux ARM clients
<ul>
<li>BRP project</li>
<li>FGRP project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BOINC client for OpenWrt</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2 name=einstein>ARM 64bit clients for Einstein@Home</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://einsteinathome.org">Einstein@Home</a> is a very fine project for BOINC, accompanying its development for 15+ years. It is all about finding pairs of pulsars and gravitational waves.
</p>
<p>
These 64bit binaries for ARM exist, for both BRP and FGRP, have in the past been sent out on request per email and are likely to move here - give this new site a few days/weeks to settle.
Eventually, in an ideal world, the project maintainers would rebuild or just adopt and redistribute them, though. It is yet a bit unclear if, in the longer term, by offering these binaries separately, we may be doing a disservice to the community. We will give exact instructions here how to reproduce what we came up with and then also place the binaries - please don't just run arbitrary binaries from web sites since this may pose security risks - to your computer and to the scientific mission of the project.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time consider to run Rosetta@Home <a href="http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/">http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/</a>) or TN-GRID (<a href="http://gene.disi.unitn.it/test/">http://gene.disi.unitn.it/test/</a>) that already support the ARM 64bit platform.

<h2 name=openwrt>BOINC Client for the OpenWrt Router OS</h2>
<p>
Our <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/11768">pull request</a> to consider BOINC for redistribution with <a href="https://www.openwrt.org">OpenWrt</a> just went out in early April. This is still an ongoing development, e.g. for an integration with the web-interface via which routers are configured. And nothing will happen until the pull request is decided about, but we are very much looking forward to it all since it means that:
<ul>
<li>there are plenty of energy-efficient machines running 24/7 with spare cycles that BOINC could tap into</li>
<li>OpenWrt is close to the Internet-of-Things and many devices are especially designed to interact with all sorts of sensors, which may trigger new use cases for the BOINC technology</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you want to run BOINC on your router now then please follow the pull request. Once that is in, the package will be redistributed with the OpenWrt SNAPSHOT distribution. If you just cannot wait any longer then look for an integration of the <a href="https://github.com/VolunteerComputingHelp/packages/tree/master/net/boinc">BOINC build instructions for OpenWrt</a> with your feeds of the OpenWrt SDK. We have already tested on the OpenWrt targets for the X86_64, ZYNQ and mvebu - the latter two both featuring an ARM Cortex-A9. If you have other platforms at your disposal to test the package on then this would be much appreciated.
</p>
<h3>How can this work on such small devices?</h3>
<p>
Well, yes. Small routers are typically stressed for place on their flash "drive". And if there are no spare 2MB for the boinc application then the device cannot be used for BOINC. The special demands in terms of disk space and compute alike however come from the applications that BOINC first downloads from the project's server and the scientific data that the application works on. This may exceed Gigabytes and few OpenWrt devices, if any, provide that. The trick is an external drive, like an USB stick or (for some advanced devices) a SATA device, that shall be mounted at /opt/ or /opt/boinc. All communication between BOINC and the scientific app is performed on files within /opt/boinc. This way, the device's internal drive is protected from frequent writes.
</p>
<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>
The boinc package is available as a snapshot (and in the upcoming releases) on <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages</a>/&lt;yourtarget&gt;/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_&lt;yourtarget&gt;.ipk, e.g. for
<ul>
<li>aarch64_cortex-a53: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_aarch64_cortex-a53.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_aarch64_cortex-a53.ipk</a></li>
<li>arm_cortex-a9_neon: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/arm_cortex-a9_neon/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_arm_cortex-a9_neon.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/i386_pentium4/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_arm_cortex-a9_neon.ipk</a></li>
<li>...</li>
<li>i386_pentium4: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/i386_pentium4/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_i386_pentium4.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/i386_pentium4/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_i386_pentium4.ipk</a></li>
<li>...</li>
<li>x86_86: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/x86_64/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_x86_64.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/x86_64/packages/boinc_7.16.5-1_x86_64.ipk</a></li>
</ul>
Please use opkg to install that package (or whatever was backported to your version of OpenWrt) and report difficulties as an issue <a href="https://github.com/VolunteerComputingHelp/VolunteerComputingHelp.github.io/issues">here</a> so we can improve on whatever we may not be aware about.
</p>
<p>
Run it. We have partnered up with <a href="http://gene.disi.unitn.it/test/">TN-GRID</a> (<a href="http://gene.disi.unitn.it/test/forum_thread.php?id=265#1698">who just also started a Covid-19 related extensions</a>) that needs only about 65MB of RAM to compute. If your device is running on an ARM device then this project will distribute a scientific app to you. If you are using another device with that amount of spare RAM available then please create an <a href="https://github.com/VolunteerComputingHelp/VolunteerComputingHelp.github.io/issues">issue</a> requesting a scientific app for it.
</p>
<p>
Run it on regular Linux/MacOS/Windows machines. Most Linux distros have a package for the client, otherwise refer to <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu">https://boinc.berkeley.edu</a> to download a client. <a href="boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/">Rosetta@Home</a>, <a href="http://gene.disi.unitn.it/test/">TN-GRID</a>, <a href="https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org">World Community Grid</a> and <a href="https://www.gpugrid.net">GPUGRID</a> are all addressing questions in molecular biology that should be worthwhile to support these days. Also consider <a href="https://foldingathome.org">Folding@Home</a>, that is independent from BOINC but is also doing good stuff.
